INTRODUCTION

The Llyod F. Moss Free Clinic Educational Website is an application that provides database and management of Educational Material for clinic patients.

https://mossfreeclinic.org/

The application allows administrators to create, update, and delete educational material. It also allows admins to create surveys to get patient feedback.

Patients can search for and view educational material and provide a rating. Patients can also fill in and submit feedback through surveys.

The overall goal of this site is to allow administators to creat educational such that:
    1. Patients can read educational material pertaining to their medical condition.
    2. Patients can provide feedback on how helpful their time at the clinic was.
